<h2> Java Chat Room  </h2>

<div id="Basic-features">
    <h3> 1. Basic Features </h3>
    <p> You are expected to write a small chat application with Java. A basic application must have the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Multi-Client Chat(20%).</b> The application should have both a server and a client implementation to maintain
            a chat room and allow multiple users to chat together.</li>
        <li><b>Login System(20%).</b> The program should have a login window (<i>Note that a registration system is not
            necessary. See the advanced features listed below</i>). The profiles (e.g., age, gender, and address) and
            their account information (e.g., usernames and passwords) must be recorded in a database. Every time a user
            logins, the program should check whether his or her account exist and if the input password matches records
            in the dataset.</li>
        <li><b>Java GUI (20%). </b> The program should have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This interface should be
            user-friendly, with buttons, text fields, and other features to maintain a comfortable experience. The
            command interface is not allowed.</li>
        <li><b>Documentation, Presentation, and Code (20%). </b> 1) Please write a tutorial about the main features
            in your project, including how do you implement them and how to run your code. Please make sure TAs can run
            your code on their machine. (10%) 2) Please prepare a presentation for your project by recording
            a video. The video should record the screen while your code is running on your laptop or desktop (5%). 3) Please
            prepare your code for submission. The main functions and classes in the code must have comments in a
            reader-friendly format. (5%) </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="Advanced-features">
    <h3> 2. Advanced Features </h3>
    <p> Note that you can earn 80% of your scores by submitting the project with the above basic features. That is to say,
        to get a higher score, you may want to consider adding some advanced features
        (<font color="Brown"> Please <b>pick</b> some features from the followings.
            The corresponding bonus scores will be added to your final score, and the upper bound of your final score is 100%.
            That's to say, you can get at most 100% by picking four 5% features or one 10% with two 5% features.
        </font>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Registration system (5%).</b> new users can register in this system. The information must be
            written to the dataset so that new user can login in. </li>
        <li><b>Emoji (5%):</b> the chat box should allow the users to send emojis. The list of emojis can be pre-loaded
            into the application or uploaded by users..</li>
        <li><b>Sending Pictures (5%).</b> The chat box should allow the users to send pictures.
            The pictures can be uploaded by users.</li>
        <li><b>Sending Videos(5%).</b> The chat box should allow the users to send voice messages. This voice can be
            pre-recorded (on the local machine) and collected online.</li>
        <li><b>Animation (5%).</b> The chat window, login window, and registration window should have some background
            animations so that the interface looks fancier..</li>
        <li><b>Voice Chat (5%).</b> The program supports voice chat in the real time among multiple users.</li>
        <li><b>Message History (5%).</b> Client can storage the chat message. The previously stored message can be resumed when the same client login the other time. The message should be store in the server (e.g., Database).
        <li><b>Editing History (5%).</b> Client can edit the message sent within 2 minutes. The editing includes retreating, changing and quoting the text message. All other clients must be aware of this edit.
        <li><b>Web Application (10%-15%). </b> transfer the local system to a web application with basic web tools or
            more updated tools. These tools include Java servlet (10%), JSP (10%), Struts (10%), Spring (10%) or
            SpringBoot (15%).</li>
        <li><b>Other cool features (5%):  </b> if you have other cool ideas for improving your project, please let me
            know as early as possible (<font color="Brown">Before Feb. 28th, 2023</font>) and I will consider some extra top-ups.</li>
