<p><h2> Java Games </h2></p>

<hr>

<div id="Basic-features">
    <h3> 1. Basic Features </h3>
    <p> You are expected to write a small chat application with Java. A basic application must have the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A New Game (30%).</b>
            You are expected to write a new game instead of reproducing some old games.  You should
            design the game rules, the controlling methods, and other visual patterns. To implement your idea with java,
            you are encouraged to use a Java game engine (e.g., FXGL, see reference.)
        </li>
        <li><b>Login System(20%).</b> The program should have a login window (<i>Note that a registration system is not
            necessary. See the advanced features listed below</i>). The profiles (e.g., age, gender, and address) and
            their account information (e.g., usernames and passwords) must be recorded in a database. Every time a user
            logins, the program should check whether his or her account exist and if the input password matches records
            in the dataset.</li>
        <li><b>Java GUI (20%). </b> The program should have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This interface should be
            user-friendly, with buttons, text fields, and other features to maintain a comfortable experience. The
            command interface is not allowed.</li>
        <li><b>Documentation, Presentation, and Code (20%). </b> 1) Please write a tutorial about the main features
            in your project, including how do you implement them and how to run your code. Please make sure TAs can run
            your code on their machine. (10%) 2) Please prepare a presentation for your project by recording
            a video. The video should record the screen while your code is running on your laptop or desktop (5%). 3) Please
            prepare your code for submission. The main functions and classes in the code must have comments in a
            reader-friendly format. (5%) </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="Advanced-features">
    <h3> 2. Advanced Features </h3>
    <p> Note that you can earn 90% of your scores by submitting the project with the above basic features. That is to say,
        to get a higher score, you may want to consider adding some advanced features:(
        <font color="Brown"> Please <b>pick</b> some features from the followings.
            The corresponding bonus scores will be added to your final score, and the upper bound of your final score is 100%.
            That's to say, you can get at most 100% by picking two 5% features or one 10% feature.
        </font>)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Voice (5%).</b> The game should have some background music and other voice signals for a better playing
            experience.</li>
        <li><b>Video (5%).</b> the game should show some video in some key places, like starting and ending.
            You can create these videos or download them from the web. </li>
        <li><b>Multiple Players (10%).</b> The game should support multiple players in a program. These players can
            play on the same game by controlling different characters. The implementation of server and client might be required. </li>
        <li><b>Web Game (10%-15%).</b> transfer the local game to a web game with basic web tools or more updated tools.
            These tools include Java servlet (10%), JSP (10%), Struts (10%), Spring (10%) or SpringBoot (15%).</li>
        <li><b>Other cool features (5%):  </b> if you have other cool ideas for improving your project, please let me
            know as early as possible (<font color="Brown">Before Feb. 28th, 2023</font>) and I will consider some extra top-ups.</li>
