<h2> Java Movie Management System  </h2>

<div id="Basic-features">
    <h3> 1. Basic Features </h3>
    <p> You are expected to write a movie management system in Java.
    A basic system should have the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>User and Manager Systems (20%): </b> the program should have different systems for client and mangers.
            They share the same login window. If you login as a manager, you should be able to add (remove) some movies
            to (from) the system and see all the movie ratings from different users. The managers should be able to see
            the statistics of these ratings, movie types and users ages. The statistics should be presented by chart
            plots and bar plots (visualization required). The user logins to a different window, where they can see the
            movie information (including images and words). The user can rate and comments about the movie. The ratings
            and comments must be recorded by the system.</li>
        <li><b>Login System(20%).</b> The program should have a login window (<i>Note that a registration system is not
            necessary. See the advanced features listed below</i>). The profiles (e.g., age, gender, and address) and
            their account information (e.g., usernames and passwords) must be recorded in a database. Every time a user
            logins, the program should check whether his or her account exist and if the input password matches records
            in the dataset.</li>
        <li><b>Java GUI (20%). </b> The program should have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This interface should be
            user-friendly, with buttons, text fields, and other features to maintain a comfortable experience. The
            command interface is not allowed.</li>
        <li><b>Documentation, Presentation, and Code (20%). </b> 1) Please write a tutorial about the main features
            in your project, including how do you implement them and how to run your code. Please make sure TAs can run
            your code on their machine. (10%) 2) Please prepare a presentation for your project by recording
            a video. The video should record the screen while your code is running on your laptop or desktop (5%). 3) Please
            prepare your code for submission. The main functions and classes in the code must have comments in a
            reader-friendly format. (5%) </li>
    </ul>

<div id="Advanced-features">
    <h3> 2. Advanced Features </h3>
    <p> Note that you can earn 80% of the scores by submitting the project with the above basic features. That is to say,
        to get a higher score, you may want to consider adding some advanced features:
        (<font color="Brown"> Please <b>pick</b> some features from the followings.
            The corresponding bonus scores will be added to your final score, and the upper bound of your final score is 100%.
            That's to say, you can get at most 100% by picking four 5% features or one 10% with two 5% features.
        </font>)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Moving recommendation (5%-10%). </b> The users can receive movie recommendations. The recommended movies
            are among the ones that a user has not rated or watched. You should write an algorithm to determine which
            movie to recommend. If your algorithm is rule-based (use manually designed logics, e.g., based on features
            like age and gender), the top-up will be 5%. If the algorithm is based on advanced data mining and machine
            learning techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering), the top-up will be 10%.</li>
        <li><b>Registration system (5%).</b> new users can register in this system. The information must be
            written to the dataset so that new user can login in. </li>
        <li><b>Pictures Uploading (5%).</b> the users can upload pictures when they post their comments to the movie.
            The managers can upload movie posters when they add movies to the system.</li>
        <li><b>Videos Uploading (5%).</b> The managers can upload videos about the movie into the system. The videos
            can be seen by the users when they review the movie information.</li>
        <li><b>Animation (5%).</b> the statistic plots, login window, and registration window should have some
            background animations so that the interface looks fancier.</li>
        <li><b>Web Application (10%-15%). </b> transfer the local system to a web application with basic web tools or
            more updated tools. These tools include Java servlet (10%), JSP (10%), Struts (10%), Spring (10%) or
            SpringBoot (15%).</li>
        <li><b>Other cool features (5%):  </b> if you have other cool ideas for improving your project, please let me
            know as early as possible (<font color="Brown">Before Feb. 28th, 2023</font>) and I will consider some extra top-ups.</li>
    </ul>

<h3> 3. Submission </h3>
Submission should be made at the <a href="https://bb.cuhk.edu.cn/">blackboard system<a>.
    You need to submit:
    <ul>
        <li>Your code that can run on TAs' devices.</li>
        <li>A short video (in a friendly format like .mp4.) that demos your implemented functions as stated in the grading guidelines.</li>
        <li>A report following the requirements on the course website. (preferably in .pdf, but .docx and .doc are both acceptable). </li>
    </ul>
